# Adversarial-Attacks-on-3D-Facial-Recognition

## Project Description
This project aims to research and implement adversarial attacks on 3D facial recognition systems,
primarily using depth and normal images for testing and experimentation.

## Features
- Computes depth maps and normal maps from facial point clouds using the FRGC dataset.
- Enhances image quality by conducting facial attacks focused on regions of interest.
- Explores direct point cloud attacks utilizing 2D information.


## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
