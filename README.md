# Adversarial-Attacks-on-3D-Facial-Recognition

## Project Description
This project aims to research and implement adversarial attacks on 3D facial recognition systems,
primarily using depth and normal images for testing and experimentation.

## Features
- Computes depth maps and normal maps from facial point clouds using the FRGC dataset.
- Enhances image quality by conducting facial attacks focused on regions of interest.
- Explores direct point cloud attacks utilizing 2D information.

## Acknowledgements
This project references code from the following GitHub repositories:

1. [Led3D by muyouhang](https://github.com/muyouhang/Led3D) - Used for depth map calculations.
2. [pytorch-grad-cam by jacobgil](https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam) - Integrated for visualization and gradient-based attention maps.

We have made modifications to the original code to fit our projectâ€™s specific needs while adhering to the respective licenses.
